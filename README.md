# Python_Telnet_Client
Just a very badly written python telnet client

This client is not something I am proud of but that is mostly to do with how telnet prompts, outputs, etc are not really universal and this made some things difficult. This client takes several files to execute commands and does have upload and download feature. I do not plan on editing it more since I hate python a lot.
